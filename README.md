We went to [Fabulous Fern's](http://www.fabulousferns.com/) on [Selby Avenue](https://goo.gl/maps/DYUfsL5wkws). We had a big group, like a dozen people. And they do a great job with big groups. We've done that before a couple of times. They do have the 18% gratuity for 8 or more people, but they have lots of room. They have a big dining area, great french fries, and really good desserts too. But I'm here to talk about the coffee.

So the decaf coffee was really hot. It was a number 5. It had a pretty good flavor. A number 4. And for refills, I'm only going to give them a 3, because I had to ask for refills a couple of times. The price was $2.95, so we'll give them a 2.95. So I guess we'll give them 3 dollar signs on that one.

As a sad update, Fabulous Fern's is now permanently closed. I can't believe they are closed because it was always busy. I hope my #3 refill rating wasn't part of their downfall. We will have to find a new place for our group.
