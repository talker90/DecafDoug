We went to [Carmelo's Ristorante](http://www.carmelos.com/Site/home.html) here in St. Paul and we went with fellow coffee bloggers [Kinda Different](https://kindadifferent.net/wp/). So the restaurant has a European feel to it, with lots of photos of Italian scenery. And the decaf had a European flavor to it. Very distinct flavor, it was really good.

So we'd give it a number 4. It was hot, so a number 4 for that one too. For refills we'd give it a number 4 and for price it was only $1.95. The link to Carmelo's, is [carmelos.com](http://www.carmelos.com/Site/home.html) but link for another great coffee blog is [kindadifferent.net](https://kindadifferent.net/wp/).

**Price**: ☆☆☆

We went to the [Chanhassen](https://www.chanhassendt.com/) dinner theater to see the show [Newsies](https://www.chanhassendt.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=newsies&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=), it was a really good show, and the coffee service was **super**!

So I got my decaf right away and it was hot. The flavor was okay, a number 3. But the incredible thing is that I had coffee with dinner then, at intermission, they brought a *fresh pot of coffee*! It was great. I was just thinking that I could use another a cup of coffee during intermission and then there she was, a whole pot. It was tremendous. The other thing was the coffee was included with the meal, there was no extra charge for all of that coffee. So if you are a coffee drinker like I am, the Chanhassen is a great place to go for a show. And they did a great job with the production of [Newsies](https://www.chanhassendt.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=newsies&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=).

We went to [Carbone's](http://carbonesonrandolph.com/carbonesonrandolph/HOME.html). Of course you have to have coffee with pizza too right. I ordered a decaf and they made a fresh pot for me, so it was really hot. Like a number 5. And the flavor was alright, it was a number 3. For refills I'd have to give them a number 3 for that too, because I had to ask a couple of times. But the price was really good, it was only $1.50. So we'll give them a 1 and a half for that ( ;) ). The only thing is they have powdered creamers. I don't really care for that too much. But it worked out okay.

They have really good pizza there at [Carbone's](http://carbonesonrandolph.com/carbonesonrandolph/HOME.html). It's a nice place to go. It's a family place and they have a bar there too. So if you want to have a beer with your pizza you can do that. Or if you want to have a coffee with your pizza, like I do, you can do that too.
