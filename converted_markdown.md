We went to [Carmelo's Ristorante](http://www.carmelos.com/Site/home.html) here is St. Paul and we went with fellow coffee bloggers [Kinda Different](https://kindadifferent.net/wp/). 
 So the restaurant has a European feel to it, with lots of photos of Italian scenery. 
 And the decaf had a European flavor to it. 
 Very distinct flavor, it was really good.


So we'd give it a number 4. 
 It was hot, so a number 4 for that one too. 
 For refills we'd give it a number 4 and for price it was only $1.95.

We went to the [Chanhassen](https://www.chanhassendt.com/) dinner theater to see the show [Newsies](https://www.chanhassendt.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=newsies&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=), it was a really good show, and the coffee service was **super**!


So I got my decaf right away and it was hot. 
 The flavor was okay, a number 3. 
 But the incredible thing is that I had coffee with dinner then, at intermission, they brought a *fresh pot of coffee*! 
 It was great. 
 I was just thinking that I could use another a cup of coffee during intermission and then there she was, a whole pot. 
 It was tremendous. 
 The other thing was the coffee was included with the meal, there was no extra charge for all of that coffee. 
 So if you are a coffee drinker like I am, the Chanhassen is a great place to go for a show. 
 And they did a great job with the production of [Newsies](https://www.chanhassendt.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=newsies&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=).

We went to [Carbone's](http://carbonesonrandolph.com/carbonesonrandolph/HOME.html). 
 Of course you have to have coffee with pizza too right. 
 I ordered a decaf and they made a fresh pot for me, so it was really hot. 
 Like a number 5. 
 And the flavor was alright, it was a number 3. 
 For refills I'd have to give them a number 3 for that too, because I had to ask a couple of times. 
 But the price was really good, it was only $1.50. 
 So we'll give them a 1 and a half for that ( ;) ). 
 The only thing is they have powdered creamers. 
 I don't really care for that too much. 
 But it worked out okay.


They have really good pizza there at [Carbone's](http://carbonesonrandolph.com/carbonesonrandolph/HOME.html). It's the one in St. Paul on Randolph. 
 It's been there since the 50's. 
 And the kids always liked that pizza too. 
 It is a thin crust and they cut it in squares. 
 So we really like the pizza there. 
 And the decaf? 
 Well it was okay.

We went to [Fabulous Fern's](http://www.fabulousferns.com/) on [Selby Avenue](https://goo.gl/maps/DYUfsL5wkws). 
 We had a big group group, like a dozen people. 
 And they do a great job with big groups. 
 We've done that before a couple of times. 
 They do have the 18% gratuity for 8 or more people, but they have lots of room. 
 They have a big dining area, great french fries, and really good desserts too. 
 But I'm here to talk about the coffee.


So the decaf coffee was really hot. 
 It was a number 5. 
 It had a pretty good flavor. 
 A number 4. 
 And for refills, I'm only going to give them a 3, because I had to ask for refills a couple of times. 
 The price was $2.95, so we'll give them a 2.95.
 So I guess we'll give them 3 dollar signs on that one.


As a sad update, Fabulous Fern's is now permanently closed. 
 I can't believe they are closed because it was always busy. 
 I hope my #3 refill rating wasn't part of their downfall. 
 We will have to find a new place for our group.

We went to [Applebee's](https://www.applebees.com/en), the one in [Eagan](https://goo.gl/maps/WTNjSpWVqrS2), there are a lot of Applebee's around lately. 
 So I ordered my decaf. They made me a fresh pot. 
 They had a nice ceramic mug and a nice presentation, with the creamers and spoon on a little plate.


It was really hot. 
 And the flavor, well, it was average. Like a #3. 
 For the refills I'd give them a #4, they were really good about that and they brought a fresh mug out every time. 
 So they didn't bring a pot and fill your mug, they'd just bring another mug of coffee out. 
 The price was $2.39, so we'll give that a 2. 
 It's always nice to have a fresh pot of hot, fresh decaf with your dinner.

 The [Cherokee Tavern](http://cherokeetavern.com/). 
 I went there on the week of my birthday because on Thursday on the week of your birthday you get a *free* steak dinner at a $20 value (!) 
 I ordered my decaf coffee and it was pretty good. 
 It was a number 4 for flavor and the temperature was a number 4. 
 It could have been a little hotter. Could have been better with the refills. 
 Although, he did make me a fresh pot of coffee, so that was great. 
 But for the refills I still have to give him a 3 for the frequency. 
 The price was $2.75, so that would be a $$ for the price.
 



 Also for your birthday you get a little piece of cake for dessert. 
 It's kind of neat, they write "Happy Birthday" in chocolate sauce on your plate. 
 That's when I had my fresh pot of coffee, at the end with my cake. 
 It was really good.

We went to [Valley Natural Foods](https://www.valleynaturalfoods.com/) in Burnsville. 
 So they are the food co-op for the South metro. 
 I heard that they have the "*best*" decaf, so I had to go check it out.
 And I must admit, it was pretty good.
 I had an Americano and the large was only $2.50, so I thought that was a pretty good deal. 
 It was very hot, a number 5, and yeah, pretty good, so a number 4.


It was a nice spot in the front of the store with tables, chairs, and a lot of natural light. 
 They have a lot of windows and the sun was out.
 Of course it was a cold day, but it was nice and sunny having our coffee inside. 
 I'm not sure what the coffee was, but the cream was an organic cream. 
 It is a place that promotes eating healthy and community. 
 They have a lot of things going on there about organic foods, eating healthy, classes, and things like that. 
 And there are no refills, so we can't give them a score for refills, but it was very good coffee.

 There's a new restaurant in Highland, [Agra Culture](http://agra-culture.com/), on [Cleveland and Highland Parkway](https://goo.gl/maps/JHrRbiQnmZM2). 
 Great. 
 Place. 
 All of their booths have plug-ins for your electronics, it's pretty neat.
 



 So with my food I ordered decaf and they made me an Americano. 
 It was really hot, a number 5, but the flavor, well, it was like a 3 and 1/2. 
 It seemed a little watered down and it was $3 so that would give it a #3 on the price. 
 And for refills, they didn't have any refills but they had their regular coffee out, a light roast and a dark roast in an airpot (SP?), so I had refills of *regular* coffee. 
 So on refills for the decaf we'd have to just give them a number 1.

 We went to the [Louisiana Cafe](http://newlouisianacafe.com/) on Selby Avenue. 
 They have the same menu as the [Grandview Grill](http://www.grandview-grill.com/menu.html), except their specials are different. 
 They have a little more cajun feel to their specials. 
 They serve [Morningstar coffee](https://morningstarcoffee.com/), they have a nice sized mug which I like, and it was $2.75 so we'll have to give it a 2 for the price. 
 The temperature was hot, like a number 5, but the flavor was only average, like a 3. 
 But they did have a really good flavored creamer, [caramel macchiato](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008R3MSNE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008R3MSNE&linkCode=as2&tag=talker90-20&linkId=bc3808eb4a8bb0171f8fa89a7431a7f6)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=talker90-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B008R3MSNE)
 which was "mmm mmm good." 
 The refills were great, I'd have to give them a number 5 on that, and they have a parking lot there which is a nice thing on Selby Avenue. 
 They also have a large dining room so I remember we've went there with a big group before.

 We went to the [Highland Cafe and Bakery](http://www.highlandcafeandbakery.com/) and the coffee was really hot. 
 They had this great thermo-karaf, so I'd have to give their temperature a number 5. 
 Because I got a whole karaf of coffee, I have to give the refills a number 5 as well. 
 However, the flavor was only a number 2, so luckily there was regular coffee there too. 
 Although the half-caff was good, the decaf was only a number 2 for flavor and it was $2.50 so it'd be a number 2.5 for price. 
 We usually go there for brunch or breakfast, but it's also a really good place for lunch or dinner too so we've done that a few times. 
 They have a lot of really good bakery stuff too. 
 They bake it right there and they have all kinds of pies, cakes, caramel rolls, and cinnamon rolls. 
 So, it's a good place to go but make sure when you order the decaf, somebody else orders the regular coffee so that you get a really good cup of coffee.

 We were in of the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) area so we stopped at [Kafe, with a "K," 421](http://www.kafe421.com/).
 It's in [Dinkytown](http://dinkytownusa.org/) actually.
 It's a very nice restaurant and we wanted to stop there to celebrate an academic achievement, so that was pretty neat.
 As the decaf coffee, hmm, the best thing about it is that they are really good on the refills.
 So I'd give them a number 5 for that.
 For flavor, it was a 3, so I guess it was about average.
 But then it wasn't that hot, so I'd have to give it a 3 on temperature.
 And 2 for the price because it was $2.50.
 So it was a nice place to go for a celebration but the coffee wasn't the best, but the refill service was fantastic.

 We stopped at [Augustine's Bar & Bakery](http://augustinesmn.com/) last night for dinner.
 It was kind of a late dinner but there were still a few tables there.
 It's over on Selby avenue and it used to be laundry mat but they've transformed it into a great restaurant.
 So we ordered our dinner and I ordered my decaf coffee.
 She said she would make it an americano (!)
 I guess they have a different coffee service there.
 The flavor was good, it was fresh coffee, and it was nice and hot. 
 Wo we'll have to give it a 5 for flavor and a 4 for temperature.
 And for *refills*, they offered me a refill on my americano which was great for me.
 When I was there once before, they made a pot of decaf for me when I asked about refills.
 So I'd have to give them a 5 for refils because they are going above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that I had a refil on my coffee.
 As for price, it is a number 3 because it's $3 coffee.

 We went to the cousins' lunch today and we went to [Lucky's](http://www.luckys13pub.com/) 13 in Burnsville.
 And the decaf was good.
 I'd say, I was debating between a 3 and 4, but I guess we'll go with a 4 on that one.
 And it was hot.
 For the refills, they always brought a new mug out. Which, I don't know, was kinda neat.
 Instead of bringing a pot of coffee, they'd brought a fresh mug out for you.
 As for refills, it wasn't the best. You always had to ask or refills, but I did have enough.
 So I guess we could give them a 4 on that one too.
 And they also have their breakfast specials go until1 o'clock on the weekends.
 So some people had lunch and some people had breakfast.
 They had some really neat breakfast specials.
 And of course, it's always good to get together and talk about the good old days over a cup of coffee and breakfast or lunch.

 And the coffee was *fantastic.*
 It was really hot.
 I had to put a sleeve on my cup it was so hot.
 And the flavor was good.
 They called it "blanched almond and golden raisin". 
 That may be a little dramatic, but it did have really good flavor.
 So I'd definitely have to give the flavor a 5 and a 5 for temperature.
 You'll have to check on the price when you go, I got mine for free.
 One suggestion for improvement, they didn't have the decaf server labelled so the barista had to help.

 A real steak house: they have 4 menu items and 3 of them are steak. The other one is shrimp. You get potato, salad, and bread with your steak dinner (unless you want the shrimp of course).
 



 I got the decaf coffee and it was really hot, so a number 5 on that one.
 And they kept it full. They brought me a pot and then they brought me *another* pot.
 The flavor was okay, so that'd be a 3.
 And for the price I'd give it a 2.95 ;) It was $2.95 for the coffee.
 



 It said 
 [Folgers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010ULFNW8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B010ULFNW8&linkCode=as2&tag=talker90-20&linkId=c7e0b3ce264e5bb9d551b6fd567c2f50)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=talker90-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B010ULFNW8)
 on the coffee pot, but i'm not really sure if it was

 or not.
 But it was okay coffee.
 



 They do have a [birthday club](http://theplaceforsteak.com/birthday-club.html) there too, so I would sign up for that.
 Then you can get a steak dinner for free if you get one that's a certain price, or you get a certain amount off on your bill.
 So that's a pretty good way to celebrate your birthday:
 a steak dinner and a pot of decaf coffee.

 So the Grandview Grill has [Morningstar Coffee](https://morningstarcoffee.com/) and it is $2.75 so I guess that would be a high 2.
 The regular coffee was good, but the decaf was only so-so, a little weak.
 But it was nice and hot, like a number 4.
 And the refill service was *excellent*, so I'd have to give that a number 5.
 They didn't give us a pot of coffee, but the waitress was already right there whenever you needed more coffee.

 The [Neighborhood Cafe](http://www.theneighborhoodcafemn.com/). 
 The flavor was a 3, no, we'll go for 4. 
 The coffee was really hot, so I would say it was a 4 for the temperature. 
 Also it's hard to find a parking spot over there on Selby and Snelling. 
 So what we did is drop somebody off and they go to get the table while you park the car. 
 So that was the only bad thing about the [Neighborhood Cafe](http://www.theneighborhoodcafemn.com/) is that it's hard to park. 
 They are really fast. 
 They had my coffee at the table right away. 
 When she came back to check on us, I asked for the refills. 
 And we had a couple of "farmer's breakfasts," which are a really good deal. 
 So it was a great experience at the [Neighborhood Cafe](http://www.theneighborhoodcafemn.com/)




 I have a [Neighborhood Cafe](http://www.theneighborhoodcafemn.com/) update: 
 I found out they use [Dunn Brother's Coffee](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R1V54NY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00R1V54NY&linkCode=as2&tag=talker90-20&linkId=52f08c8f992af54cba19d2228d53291e)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=talker90-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00R1V54NY) which is roasted like 3 blocks away from the restaurant, so that's why their coffee is so good!

 We went to [Salsa a la Salsa](https://www.salsaalasalsa.com/) which is in the Midtown Global Market. 
 The coffee was *super*! 
 They had a nice cup too :) I like their mugs. 
 They were clear, glass mugs that are kind of tall. 
 So the coffee even looks good in it.
 



 They made a fresh pot of decaf for me. 
 It was nice, hot, and fresh. 
 So I'd have to give it number 5 for temperature. 
 The flavor was good so, let's see, we'll give that a number 4 and the price was a number 3 because it was $3 bucks. 
 And then the refills, I'd give that a number 5, they were really good about keeping my cup full. 
 They used to validate parking which was a bonus, however the last time we were there they did not. 
 So that was a plus. 
 So it was good coffee, we had a nice lunch, and free parking so that was super.

 Baker Square coffee!
 We went to Baker Square today. 
 I must say we go to Baker Square quite a bit.
 Because we like breakfast and brunch I guess.
 But their coffee isn't as good as it used to be.
 And my decaf panel of experts agreed with me, that years ago Baker Square coffee was better.
 It lacks flavor.
 So for flavor I would give it a number 2.
 But I will say, they are terrific on refills because they give you a pot of coffee right away.
 The coffee is really hot and the price is reasonable.
 Talk about hot coffee! At Baker Square they even give you a hot *cup*. 
 The last couple of times I stopped there I noticed that the cup is actually hot before you even pour your coffee. 
 What a great idea!
 



 So if they went back to how they brewed in the 90's, I think they'd be all set.
 It seems like they used to grind their beans fresh then. 
 They had a different coffee service in how they had it set up.
 Now, they brew the coffee in the back, they don't have it out by the customers so I can't tell how they do it.
 But it definitely doesn't have the flavor it used to have.
 



 Update: I found a new favorite pie to go with my coffee, chocolate hazelnut silk. 
 So this is Decaf Doug ™ from Baker Square.
 We usually go to Highland, but I guess they have a few around.
 Okay! Bye.

 So I went to [SuperAmerica](http://superamerica.com/StoreHome/4428) for coffee and got a free coffee, but they didn't have any decaf!
 So I got the regular Colombian Supremo.
 It was super hot, so I'd have to give it a number 5 for that.
 I had to wait a minute before I could actually start drinking my coffee (!), which is really hot.
 The flavor was okay.
 You don't get a refill, but you get a 24 ounce cup, which is like a half a pot of coffee.
 And then the price was super, because it was free for Coffee Day.
 But it's usually a dollar, 99¢ is what they advertise.
 It was kind of disappointing that they didn't have decaf.
 It's the afternoon so I was really looking forward to drinking decaf.
 So I can't really drink all of my regular coffee.
 So I'll have to pace myself and maybe save some for tomorrow morning.
 


 Happy Coffee Day!

 So [Holiday](http://www.holidaystationstores.com/) coffee, I can't believe they have a shop set-up just like if you went into the gas station, but it's at the [Mall of America](https://www.mallofamerica.com/)!
 So you can get your [Holiday](http://www.holidaystationstores.com/) coffee right there.
 The flavor of the decaf was only about a 2, but it was hot and it was fresh.
 This was in the afternoon, but they were still making more coffee.
 They had flavored creamers, so I was able to flavor up my decaf with hazelnut.
 So that was pretty good.
 There were no refills, but I had a coupon for free 20 ounce cup, so that was a pretty good deal.
 It's a pretty good price I would think in general, I don't usually get Holiday coffee

 We went out to [I Nonni](http://www.inonnirestaurant.com/) in Mendota Heights along the banks of the Mississippi River.
 We asked for a window seat, they had the curtains closed but you could still kind of see out the window.
 The coffee was very good, number 5 for sure.
 It was hot so I think that would be a 5 on temperature too.
 *And* she kept my cup full so that would be a 5 again (!), but the price was high.
 



 It was a bigger cup, maybe a 12 oz cup, but it was a nice shaped coffee cup. 
 The waitress would fill it around 3/4s full which was good because then you could put your cream in there with a little spoon to stir with.
 And I think it stayed hotter until you got down to the bottom of the cup because it wasn't so full
 And we had a 
 [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/), 
 so we got a good deal on the food.
 But, of course, the decaf was the most important thing and *that* was excellent.

 We're in St. Paul at the [Heirloom restaurant](http://www.heirloomstpaul.com/).
 The coffee flavor was really good.
 I'd have to give it a 4.
 But as for the service, they didn't always keep my cup full.
 So I had to ask for a cup.
 Once a waiter did offer me a cup and he talked about decaf, but afterwards he brought me a cup of regular instead.
 He realized what he had done and I did get my decaf.
 So for refills I'd have to say it was about a 3 and for temperature I'd say about a 4.

 for decaf today and got a flavored coffee.
 It was a decaf milk chocolate mocha.
 They have a Tuesday special in August: 2 menu items for $5 dollars.
 So it was a really good deal.
 And it was hot and delicious.
 That's the nice thing about a coffee shop, when they roast the coffee and grind the coffee fresh it always has a great flavor.
 But then again, you don't get any refills.
 Although I could have drank both coffees instead of giving one away ;) hmmmm...
 



 So let's see, taste was really good, it was a delicious coffee, and it was hot 
 But there were no refils.
 $2.50 is kind of a high price if you don't get any refills.
 So it kind of depends on what you want

 Hello, this is Decaf Doug ™. The flavor was about average.
 I guess we could give the temperature a 5, it was really hot coffee.
 The refill frequency was good. 
 They didn't give me a pot, and they were really busy, but when my cup was empty they were still there within a minute.
 But the price was kind of high. It was $2.95 which I think makes them in a higher price range.
 The regular coffee did have a little more flavor than the decaf, but I don't know if that's a typical thing.
 So the Uptowner was very busy but still kept my coffee filled, it was hot, and it had a good flavor.
 They had a higher priced coffee but they had a coupon for my food, so it was like getting free coffee.
 Also, as a side note, they have free parking in the back before 3 o'clock which is always a good thing on Grand Avenue.

 Hello, this is Decaf Doug ™. I stopped at Snuffy's today and even though the coffee was average tasting but they were exceptional in refills.
 In fact, they even gave me a to-go cup and made *two* fresh pots of coffee!
 My cup was always filled so I never ran out of coffee. Even when I left I had coffee.
 The temperature was great, it was very hot, just how I like it.
 I think I covered everything. 
 I'd recommend it.
 And then if you go for food they usually have a coupon, but that may be another story.

 coffee was hot and fresh and they even brought me a second pot when I asked for more coffee.
 They were quick about it so I never had an empty cup.
 The coffee had a good flavor but wasn't very strong coffee while still robust.
 It was hot and fresh and good tasting coffee.
 It was an average price at $2.29.
 The last time I was at an [IHOP](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MV9OWLQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00MV9OWLQ&linkCode=as2&tag=talker90-20&linkId=edb42216cdacb6685618151b290102d7)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=talker90-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00MV9OWLQ)
 they even gave me a to-go cup for my coffee, so they are super about getting you all the coffee that you could possibly drink.
 And that's important for Decaf Doug ™, to be able to have a sip of coffee all of the time.

 I went to the Broiler today and I had an empty cup for a long time. 
 Usually they are pretty good. 
 Sometimes they bring a pot, but the waiter wanted to serve one cup at a time. 
 And they had a lot of servers so I don't know what the deal was. 
 But their coffee is pretty good, it was hot, and freshly brewed.

 We went to a wedding in [Salem, Wisconsin](https://goo.gl/maps/b1yzJDHnbTF2) at [Stein Farms](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/stein-farms-salem-wi-998035). 
 It's a big wedding center, it's a beautiful setting. 
 It was catered by the [Stowell's Catering Service](http://www.stowellscatering.com/) out of [Burlington, Wisconsin](https://goo.gl/maps/HTCNs73sd2D2), not to be confused with the [Burlington Coat Factory](https://www.burlington.com/) as the groom did when he first met the bride. 
 



 After the wedding the first thing I looked for in the dining room was the coffee. 
 It was at the cake table with their wedding cake and cookies. 
 The wedding cake didn't have the usual decorations and I heard that they call that a "naked cake." 
 It was okay coffee, a number 3, it had a decent flavor. 
 In fact it was better than the [IHOP](http://decafdoug.com/#review_ihop) coffee we had earlier in the day on the drive down. 
 It was really hot, a number 5. 
 And the temperature outside was really hot too, it was over 90 degrees and the wedding was outside. 
 We had all kinds of record highs for Memorial Weekend this year. 
 



 The coffee was in a percolator pot but it didn't get bitter over the course of the day, my last cup of coffee was almost as good as my first. 
 It was enough coffee, I just had to go over and keep filling my cup. 
 And I was close to the coffee so that was pretty handy.
 



 All in all it was a great wedding. 
 Best wishes and congratulations to the lovely bride and the groovy groom.

 We went to the [St. Mark's festival](http://www.markerspride.com/index.php/home-festival) last week. 
 It was a really neat deal. 
 They have rides for the kids, food, and music. 
 They also had decaf coffee!
 



 So I thought the first thing I would do is get a cup of decaf coffee and it was a dollar. 
 But they didn't have refills. 
 However, the interesting thing is that they were sponsored by [Coffee Bené](https://www.coffeebene.com/) which is down on [Cleveland](https://goo.gl/maps/eC9YNVR2sWM2) and is part of [Davanni's](https://www.davannis.com/) pizza and hoagies. 
 



 It was okay coffee, I'd give it a 3. 
 The price was low, but you only got one cup, there were no free refills. 
 But the temperature was a 5, it was really hot coffee, I was kind of surprised. 
 They've got a really good air-pot there that kept the temperature really hot. 
 Overall, it was fun to sit outside, listen to the music, and have dinner. 
 They have a lot of different foods there. 
 It was a fun time at the [St. Mark's festival](http://www.markerspride.com/index.php/home-festival).
